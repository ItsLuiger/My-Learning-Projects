New Features in Bank1 Extension
1. Transaction Management System
Overview: This new feature allows users to manage their financial transactions more efficiently within the Bank1 application.

Functionality:

Add Transaction: Users can now add a new transaction to their account (such as deposits or withdrawals). The system updates the balance immediately after each transaction is added.

View Transaction History: Users can view a complete list of their past transactions, making it easier to track their spending and deposits.

Delete Transactions: Users can delete specific transactions if needed (e.g., in case of an error or refund).

Impact: This feature helps to provide more control over financial activities and ensures that users can monitor and manage their accounts effectively.

2. Automatic Balance Update
Overview: The balance will be updated automatically each time a new transaction is added. This ensures that the user always has an up-to-date view of their account balance.

How It Works:

Every time a transaction (deposit or withdrawal) is processed, the system recalculates the balance.

The updated balance is displayed immediately to keep users informed of their financial status.
